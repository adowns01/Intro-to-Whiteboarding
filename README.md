# Intro to Algorithms and Whiteboarding
#### (Almost) every Wednesday 6:30pm - 8:00pm at DBC SF
- [All Powerpoints and Videos](https://github.com/adowns01/Intro-to-Whiteboarding-DBC/blob/master/powerpoint_links.md)
- [Past Questions](https://github.com/adowns01/Intro-to-Whiteboarding-DBC/blob/master/questions.md)

## What is it?

A weekly workshop created to help DBC alumi practice their technical interview skills. The workshops are generally strucutred as follows:

**6:30-7:00:** Thunder talk on an algorithms topic.

**7:00-7:45:** Split up into groups of three. A new problem is displayed every 15 minutes. Each group member solves one problem while the other two group members act as interviewers.

**7:45-8:00:** Everyone gathers back together as a large group and discusses the questions.
